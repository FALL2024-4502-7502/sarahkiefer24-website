        <h1>Design Statement</h1>
        <p>My design decisions for my website mainly focused on coherence and user experience. I chose a color palette that was bright, inviting, and fun, so that the user can navigate throughout the website without getting weighed down on which sections go with which, as the colors make it somewhat obvious how those sections go together. I chose to implement a border radius as well to center the focus of the website down to the middle portion and center my text and images from there. I also chose a simple text font so that a user wouldnâ€™t get weighed down with bold text choices or confusing ones. The navigation bar is intuitive and does not change from one page to another, so the user is not distracted while using it. On my home page, I chose to have two paragraphs at the top introducing my page, a picture of me so potential employers can put a face to the name, and my work at the bottom. That way a hiring staff can immediately find examples of my work, instead of searching through many different pages to find it.
        On my gallery page the images and buttons are the main focus of the page, helping a user navigate through the photo story in an easy and simple way. The locations and list pages I created demonstrate examples of how a user can find curated, numbered lists with some of my favorite things such as books and coffee. I kept those pages there for now so that I could turn them into either a collection of work samples that I can offer to an employer for a future job or some other type of job material.
        In addition to those choices, I changed my gallery page to reflect the feedback I received. I shortened the padding on the gallery page between the headline and the top of the page, as well as shortening the margins on other pages to draw your eye to the center of the screen no matter what media query you are on. I also shortened the margins and padding between the buttons on my gallery page and moved my footer to the outside of the border radius, with a white text font to reflect the suggestions from my peer review in class.
        Overall, I have really enjoyed this class and getting to put together my own website, which I am very proud of. I have learned a lot about working backwards in a project, and how to problem solve based on what I have learned about coding. I found myself being able to diagnose the problem and find the solution through methodically combing through my website and using the process of elimination.</p>
